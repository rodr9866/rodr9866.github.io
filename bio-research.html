            <h2>Discovering Antibiotic Resistance Gene</h2>
            <p>
                I worked on a research project where I created a data pipeling to analyze bacterial DNA.
                By comparing the DNA of antibiotic resistant bacteria to susceptible bacteria, we were able to narrow
                down genes responsible for the resistance and we discovered an undocumented resistance gene. The <a href="https://aac.asm.org/content/early/2020/08/11/AAC.00867-20" target="_blank">research article</a>
                has since been published in
                the academic journal, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy by the American Society for Microbiology. This project is what changed the course of my academic journey from Biochemistry to Computer Science. 
                I loved automating the research process through coding the data pipeline, researching through blockers, and helping someone else achieve their goals. It showed me how programming can save time for us and automate mundane or repetitive tasks. 
                It allowed my principal invesitgator to answer scientific questions and free up time to make a meaningful impact with their time. 
                The capstone project of automating class scheduling for the computer science department does this as well. 
                It reduces the time that department chairs spend on tedious rearranging of potential classes and professor schedules. 
                This way our department chairs can make a more meaningful impact with their time in other areas of their responsibility.
